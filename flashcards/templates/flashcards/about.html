      <h4>About this webpage</h4>
      This page is originally written for fun and educational purpose, aimed to 
      help myself getting started on recognizing characters in Asian 
      (specifically Buddhist) calligrapy.
      When I showed it to people around me I received enthusiastic reactions so
      I decided to improve usability and keep it online. <br /><br />
      The inspiration for making this page came entirely from reading 
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Brush-Splendor-Asian-Calligraphy/dp/1611801346">
      Heart of the Brush: The Splendor of East Asian Calligraphy</a> by Kaz 
      Tanahashi.
      The book displays wonderful calligraphy based on 150 characters, which 
      formed the curriculum for this page. <br />
